# Loom Demo Script (60s)

**Goal:** Demonstrate "Top Producer" quality to an Upwork client.

## Scene 1: The "Hook" (0:00-0:10)
*Screen: ReviewPulse Empty State (01_empty.png)*
"Hi, this is [Name]. You asked for a contract analyzer that actually works. This is ReviewPulse. It's not just a wrapper—it's a precision RAG engine built on Next.js and Pinecone."

## Scene 2: Ingestion & Speed (0:10-0:30)
*Action: Click 'Demo' button. Show 'Ingesting' status.*
"Watch this. I click 'Demo', and we instantly ingest three complex legal PDFs: an MSA, an NDA, and a SaaS agreement. No waiting. We extract text, chunk it, and index it in real-time."
*Screen: Ingested State (02_ingested.png)*

## Scene 3: The "Magic" (0:30-0:50)
*Action: Click 'Query' on the pre-filled question.*
"Now I ask: 'Summarize termination provisions.' Instead of a generic answer, ReviewPulse retrieves exact clauses from all three docs. Look at the latency metric below—3 seconds. That's production-grade."
*Screen: Result State (03_ready.png)*

## Scene 4: The Close (0:50-1:00)
"I built this with a focus on auditability and speed. The code is modular, type-safe, and ready to deploy. Let's chat."
